#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file: cp dev.hcl.example dev.hcl

#
# IMPORTANT: The S3 bucket and DynamoDB table MUST exist before running terraform init
# See documentation for setup instructions

bucket         = "your-org-coder-terraform-state"  # S3 bucket name (can be same as prod)
key            = "coder/dev/terraform.tfstate"     # Different path for dev environment
region         = "us-east-1"                       # AWS region where bucket is located
encrypt        = true                              # Enable state encryption at rest
dynamodb_table = "coder-terraform-locks"           # DynamoDB table for state locking (can be same as prod)
